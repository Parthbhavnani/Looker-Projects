# FIFA Player Performance Analysis Dashboard 🎮⚽

## Overview 🌟

This project involves exploring FIFA player performance data using Looker, a powerful data exploration and visualization tool. The dataset consists of information about FIFA players and their performance metrics. The raw dataset contains around 18k rows of messy data, which will be cleaned using Python/SQL before being exported into MySQL. An amazing dashboard will then be created in Looker to visualize key insights and trends in FIFA player performance.

## Task List 📋

### Step 1: Clean the Dataset
The dataset containing FIFA player performance data will be cleaned to address messy data issues. Recommendations for cleaning the dataset include:
1. Converting height and weight columns to numerical forms.
2. Removing unnecessary newline characters from all columns.
3. Converting 'Value', 'Wage', and 'Release Clause' columns from string to numerical values. For example, 'M' in the value column represents Million, so row values will be multiplied by 1,000,000.
4. Stripping 'star' characters from some columns and converting them to numerical values.

### Step 2: Export Cleaned Dataset into MySQL
The cleaned FIFA player performance dataset will be exported into MySQL using a Python script.

### Step 3: Create Amazing Dashboard using Looker
An engaging and insightful dashboard will be created in Looker to visualize the cleaned FIFA player performance dataset. The dashboard will provide interactive visualizations and meaningful analysis to uncover key insights and trends in player performance.
